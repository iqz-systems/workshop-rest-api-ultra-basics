# REST APIs - the ultra basics

**Date:** 25th September 2020

This repository contains the sample code and some scribblings done during our internal workshop delving into the basics of REST APIs.

## How to use

To run the example code, you need NodeJS. Get it from here: https://nodejs.org/en/

After you install, navigate into the `server` directory and invoke `index.js` using the Node runtime:

```bash
cd server/
node index.js
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` to access the page in the browser.
